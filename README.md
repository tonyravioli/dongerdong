>All that is gold does not glitter,
>Not all those who donger are lost;
>The old that do dong do not wither,
>Deep dongs are not reached by the frost.
>From the ashes the donger shall be woken,
>A light from the shadows shall spring;
>Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
>The donger again shall be king
-J.R.R. Tolkien
